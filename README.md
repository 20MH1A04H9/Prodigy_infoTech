 - [Implement caesar cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/)

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique. It operates by moving the letters in the plaintext message by a predetermined number of positions, called as the "shift" or "key".

Here is an example of how to use the Caesar cipher to encrypt the message “HELLO” with a shift of 3:
Write down the plaintext message: HELLO
Choose a shift value. In this case, we will use a shift of 3.
Replace each letter in the plaintext message with the letter that is three positions to the right in the alphabet.

         H becomes K (shift 3 from H)

         E becomes H (shift 3 from E)

         L becomes O (shift 3 from L)

         L becomes O (shift 3 from L)

 - [Mainpulation for image Encryption](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/security/encrypting-images)
 Pixel manipulation is an innovative technique to image encryption that employs cryptographic algorithms and libraries such as NumPy and Pillow to substitute, permute, and disperse individual pixel values. This technology improves image security and is critical for securing digital information.


 - [Password Complexity Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore has created a checker that estimates the time it would take for cybercriminals to figure out a password. Passwords are not saved or stored; it is solely intended for instructional reasons.

- [Simple Keylogger](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger?)
A keylogger, sometimes called a keystroke logger, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke on a specific device, such as a computer or smartphone

- [Network Packet Analyzer](https://www.wireshark.org/)
A packet sniffer (also known as a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer, or network analyzer) is a piece of hardware or software that monitors network traffic. Sniffers examine streams of data packets that move between networked computers and the greater Internet.
